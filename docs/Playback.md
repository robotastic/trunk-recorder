# Playback & Sharing
By default, Trunk Recorder just dumps a lot of recorded files into a directory. Here are a couple of options to make it easier to browse through recordings and share them on the Internet.
* [OpenMHz](https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder/wiki/Uploading-to-OpenMHz): This is my free hosted platform for sharing recordings
* [Trunk Player](https://github.com/ScanOC/trunk-player): A great Python based server, if you want to you want to run your own
* [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner): Provide a good looking, scanner style interface for listening to Trunk Recorder
* Broadcastify Calls (API): see Radio Reference [forum thread](https://forums.radioreference.com/threads/405236/) and [wiki page](https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Broadcastify-Calls-Trunk-Recorder)
* [Broadcastify via Liquidsoap](https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder/wiki/Streaming-online-to-Broadcastify-with-Liquid-Soap)
